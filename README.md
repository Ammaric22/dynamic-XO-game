# 🧠 Dynamic XO Game

A fully functional, dynamic Tic-Tac-Toe (XO) game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Players can choose between **3x3 or 9x9 grid sizes**, select the starting player (X or O), and even **undo or redo moves** during the game. The game also tracks scores and resets automatically after each round.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. On page load, the board is generated based on your grid size selection.
2. Players take turns marking cells.
3. The game checks for win conditions dynamically (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
4. If someone wins or the board is full, the game ends and updates scores.
5. Undo/redo allows players to go back and forth between moves.
